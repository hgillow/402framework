In the next cham-<lb break="no"/>ber, <rs type="person" key="KCII">King Charles</rs>’s\r\n               and <rs type="person">the Sultan</rs>’s healths had to be <lb/>discussed at some length. In the next were\r\n               discussed the <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="122">122</fw>\r\n               \r\n               <pb n="123"/>\r\n               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n               <lb/><rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs>’s health and that of <rs type="person">his host’s wife</rs>, but more <lb/>briefly. In the\r\n               next the <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> complimented his <lb/>host upon his furniture, and the host\r\n               complimented the <lb/><rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> upon his dress. In the next, sweet meats <lb/>were\r\n               offered, the host deploring their badness, the <rs type="person" key="OrM">Am-<lb break="no"/>bassador</rs> extolling their\r\n               goodness. The ceremony ended <lb/>at length with the smoking of a hookah and the\r\n               drink-<lb break="no"/>ing of a glass of coffee; but though the motions of smok-<lb break="no"/>ing and\r\n               drinking were gone through punctiliously there <lb/>was neither tobacco in the pipe\r\n               nor coffee in the glass, <lb/>as, had either smoke or drink been real, the human\r\n               frame <lb/>would have sunk beneath the surfeit. For, no sooner had <lb/>the\r\n               <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> despatched one such visit, than another <lb/>had to be undertaken. The\r\n               same ceremonies were gone <lb/>through in precisely the same order six or seven times\r\n               <lb/>over at the houses of the other great officials, so that it <lb/>was often late\r\n               at night before the <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> reached <lb/>home. Though <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> performed these\r\n               tasks to admi-<lb break="no"/>ration and never denied that they are, perhaps, the most\r\n               <lb/>important part of a diplomatist’s duties, <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> was undoubt-<lb break="no"/>edly fatigued by\r\n               them, and often depressed to such a <lb/>pitch of gloom that <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> preferred to take his\r\n               dinner alone <lb/>with his dogs. To them, indeed<app n="8"><lem> </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">, </rdg></app><rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> might be heard talk-<lb break="no"/>ing in\r\n               his own tongue. And sometimes, it is said, <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> <lb/>would pass out of his own gates\r\n               late at night so disguised <lb/>that the sentries did not know him. Then <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> would\r\n                  <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="123">123</fw>\r\n               <pb n="124"/>\r\n               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n               <lb/>mingle with the crowd on the <rs type="place">Galata Bridge</rs>; or stroll <lb/>through the bazaars;\r\n               or throw aside his shoes and join <lb/>the worshippers in the Mosques. Once, when it\r\n               was given <lb/>out that <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> was ill of a fever, shepherds, bringing their <lb/>goats\r\n               to market, reported that they had met an English <lb/>Lord on the mountain top and\r\n               heard him praying to his <lb/>God. This was thought to be <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> himself, and his\r\n                  <lb/>prayer was, no doubt, a poem said aloud, for it was <lb/>known that <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> still\r\n               carried about with him, in the bosom <lb/>of his cloak, a <app n="9"><lem>much-scored</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">much scored</rdg></app> manuscript; and\r\n               servants, <lb/>listening at the door, heard the <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> chanting <lb/>something in\r\n                  an odd, sing-song voice when <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> was alone. </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n               <lb/>It is with fragments such as these that we must do <lb/>our best to make up a\r\n               picture of <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs>’s life and char-<lb break="no"/>acter at this time. There exist, even to\r\n               this day, rumours, <lb/>legends, anecdotes of a floating and unauthenticated\r\n               <lb/>kind about <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs>’s life in <rs type="place"> <settlement type="city">Constantinople</settlement></rs> (we have <lb/>quoted but a few of\r\n               them)<app n="10"><lem> – </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1"> </rdg></app>which go to prove that <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> pos-<lb break="no"/>sessed, now that <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> was in the prime of\r\n               life, the power to <lb/>stir the fancy and rivet the eye which will keep a memory\r\n               <lb/>green long after all that more durable qualities can do to <lb/>preserve it is\r\n               forgotten. The power is a mysterious one <lb/>compounded of beauty, birth, and some\r\n               rarer gift, which <lb/>we may call glamour and have done with it. <q type="spoken">“A million\r\n                  <lb/>candles,”</q> as <rs type="person">Sasha</rs> had said, burnt in him without his <lb/>being at the trouble\r\n               of lighting a single one. <rs type="person" key="OrM">He</rs> moved <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="124"\r\n                  >124</fw>\r\n               <pb n="125"/>\r\n               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n               <lb/>like a stag, without any need to think about his legs. <rs type="person" key="OrM">He</rs> <lb/>spoke in his\r\n               ordinary voice and echo beat a silver gong. <lb/>Hence rumours gathered round him. He\r\n               became the <lb/>adored of many women and some men. It was not neces-<lb break="no"/>sary that\r\n               they should speak to him or even that they <lb/>should see him; they conjured<app n="11"><lem> him </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1"> </rdg></app>up\r\n               before them espe-<lb break="no"/>cially when the scenery was romantic, or the sun was\r\n               <lb/>setting, the figure of a noble gentleman in silk stockings. <lb/>Upon the poor\r\n               and uneducated, <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> had the same power <lb/>as upon the rich. Shepherds, gipsies,\r\n               donkey drivers, still <lb/>sing songs about <rs type="person" key="OrM">the English Lord</rs> <q>“who dropped his\r\n                  <lb/>emeralds in the well,”</q> which undoubtedly refer to <rs type="person" key="OrM">Or-<lb break="no"/>lando</rs>, who once<app n="12"><lem> </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">, </rdg></app> it\r\n               seems tore his jewels from him in a <lb/>moment of rage or intoxication and flung\r\n               them in a foun-<lb break="no"/>tain; whence they were fished by a page boy. But this\r\n               <lb/>romantic power, it is well known, is often associated with <lb/>a nature of\r\n               extreme reserve. <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> seems to have <lb/>made no friends. As far as is known, <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs>\r\n               formed no at-<lb break="no"/>tachments. A certain great lady came all the way from <lb/><rs type="place"><country>England</country></rs>\r\n               in order to be near him, and pestered him with <lb/>her attentions, but <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> continued\r\n               to discharge his duties <lb/>so indefatigably that <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> had not been <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador at\r\n                  <lb/><rs type="place">the Horn</rs></rs> more than two years and a half before <rs type="person" key="KCII">King <lb/>Charles</rs> signified his\r\n               intention of raising him to the high-<lb break="no"/>est rank in the peerage.

But, as she <lb/><fw\r\n                  type="pageNum" rend="center" n="125">125</fw>\r\n               <pb n="126"/>\r\n               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n               <lb/>had seen him once only, and was then busily engaged in <lb/>pelting her royal\r\n               master with nutshells, it is likely that <lb/>it was his merits that won him his\r\n               Dukedom, not his <lb/>calves.</p>\r\n            <p>\r\n               <lb/>Here we must pause, for we have reached a moment <lb/>of great significance in\r\n               his career. For the conferring of <lb/>the Dukedom was the occasion of a very famous,\r\n               and in-<lb break="no"/>deed, much disputed incident, which we must now de-<lb break="no"/>scribe, picking\r\n               our way among burnt papers and little <lb/>bits of tape as best we may. It was at the\r\n               end of the great <lb/>fast of Ramadan that the <orgName>Order of the Bath</orgName> and the <lb/>patent\r\n               of nobility arrived in a frigate commanded by <rs type="person" key="SAS">Sir <lb/>Adrian Scrope</rs>; and <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs>\r\n               made this the occasion for <lb/>an entertainment more splendid than any that has been\r\n               <lb/>known before or since in <rs type="place"><settlement type="city">Constantinople</settlement></rs>. The night was <lb/>fine; the crowd\r\n               immense, and the windows of the Em-<lb break="no"/>bassy brilliantly illuminated. Again,\r\n               details are lacking, <lb/>for the fire had its way with all such records, and has\r\n               left <lb/>only tantalising fragments which leave the most impor-<lb break="no"/>tant points\r\n               obscure. From the diary of <rs type="person" key="JFB">John Fenner <lb/>Brigge</rs>, however, an <rs type="person" key="JFB">English naval</rs>\r\n               officer, who was <lb/>among the guests, we gather that people of all national-\r\n               <lb/>ities <q type="written">“were packed like herrings in a barrel”</q> in the court-<lb break="no"/>yard.

Next, <rs type="person" key="SAS">Sir\r\n                  Adrian <lb/>Scrope</rs>, in the full dress of a British Admiral<app n="18"><lem> </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">, </rdg></app>advanced; <lb/>the\r\n               <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> knelt on one knee; <rs type="person" key="SAS">the Admiral</rs> placed <lb/>the Collar of <orgName>the Most Noble\r\n                  Order of the Bath</orgName> round his <lb/>neck, then pinned the Star to his breast; after\r\n               which <lb/>another gentleman of the diplomatic corps advancing <lb/>in a stately\r\n               manner placed on his shoulders the ducal <lb/>robes, and handed him on a crimson\r\n               cushion, the ducal <lb/>coronet.”</q> </p>\r\n            <p>At length, with a gesture of extraordinary majesty <lb/>and grace, first bowing\r\n               profoundly, then raising himself <lb/>proudly erect, <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> took the golden circlet\r\n               of straw-<lb break="no"/>berry leaves and placed it, with a gesture which none <lb/>that saw it\r\n               ever forgot, upon his brows. It was at this <lb/>point that the first disturbance\r\n               began. Either the people <lb/>had expected a miracle – some say a shower of gold was\r\n               <lb/>prophesied to fall from the skies – which did not hap-<lb break="no"/>pen, or this was the\r\n               signal chosen for the attack to begin; <lb/>nobody seems to know; but as the coronet\r\n               settled on <rs type="person" key="OrM">Or-<lb break="no"/>lando</rs>’s brows a great uproar rose. Bells began ringing; <lb/>the\r\n               harsh cries of the prophets were heard above the <lb/>shouts of the people; many\r\n               <orgName>Turks</orgName> fell flat to the ground <lb/>and touched the earth with their foreheads. A door\r\n               burst <lb/>open.

A certain lady, who was said to be <lb/>dying for love of\r\n               <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs>, seized a candelabra and <lb/>dashed it to the ground. What might not have\r\n               happened, <lb/>had it not been for the presence of <rs type="person" key="SAS">Sir Adrian Scrope</rs> and <lb/>a squad\r\n               of <orgName>British bluejackets</orgName>, nobody can say. But <rs type="person" key="SAS">the <lb/>Admiral</rs> ordered the bugles to be\r\n               sounded; a hundred <lb/><orgName>bluejackets</orgName> stood instantly at attention; the disorder was\r\n               <lb/>quelled, and quiet, at least for the time being, fell upon <lb/>the scene. </p>\r\n            <p>So far, we are on the firm, if rather narrow, ground <lb/>of ascertained truth. But\r\n               nobody has ever known exactly <lb/>what took place later that night. The testimony of\r\n               the <lb/>sentries and others seems, however, to prove that the Em-<lb break="no"/>bassy was empty\r\n               of company, and shut up for the night <lb/>in the usual way by two A.M. The\r\n               <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> was seen <lb/>to go to his room, still wearing the insignia of his rank,\r\n               <lb/>and shut the door. Some say he locked it, which was <lb/>against his custom.\r\n               Others maintain that they heard <lb/>music of a rustic kind, such as shepherds play,\r\n               later that <lb/>night in the courtyard under the <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs>’s window. <lb/><rs type="person">A\r\n                  washer-woman</rs>, who was kept awake by a toothache<app n="19"><lem> </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">, </rdg></app><lb/>said that she saw a man’s\r\n               figure, wrapped in a cloak or <lb/>dressing gown, come out upon the balcony. Then,\r\n               she <lb/>said, a woman, much muffled, but apparently of the <lb/>peasant class<app n="20"><lem> </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">, </rdg></app> was\r\n               drawn up by means of a rope which the <lb/>man let down to her on to the balcony.\r\n               There, the <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="131">131</fw>\r\n               <pb n="132"/>\r\n               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n               <lb/>washer-woman said, they embraced passionately ‘like <lb/>lovers,’ and went into\r\n               the room together, drawing the <lb/>curtains so that no more could be seen. </p>\r\n            <p>Next morning, <rs type="person" key="OrM">the Duke</rs>, as we must now call him, <lb/>was found by his secretaries\r\n               sunk in profound slumber <lb/>amid bed clothes that were much tumbled. The room\r\n               <lb/>was in some disorder, his coronet having rolled on the <lb/>floor, and his cloak\r\n               and garter being flung all of a heap <lb/>on a chair. The table was littered with\r\n               papers. No sus-<lb break="no"/>picion was felt at first, as the fatigues of the night had\r\n               <lb/>been great. But when afternoon came and he still slept, <lb/>a doctor was\r\n               summoned. He applied<app n="21"><lem> the </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1"> </rdg></app>remedies which <lb/>had been used on the previous occasion,\r\n               plasters, nettles, <lb/>emetics, etc., but without success. <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> slept on. His\r\n               <lb/>secretaries then thought it their duty to examine the <lb/>papers on the table.\r\n               Many were scribbled over with <lb/>poetry, in which frequent mention was made of an\r\n               oak <lb/>tree. There were also various state papers and others of <lb/>a private\r\n               nature concerning the management of his es-<lb break="no"/>tates in <rs type="place"><country>England</country></rs>. But at length they\r\n               came upon a docu-<lb break="no"/>ment of far greater significance. It was nothing less,\r\n               <lb/>indeed, than a deed of marriage, drawn up, signed, and <lb/>witnessed between\r\n               <rs type="person" key="OrM">his Lordship, Orlando, Knight of <lb/>the Garter, <app n="22"><lem>etc. etc.</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">etc., etc.,</rdg></app> etc.,</rs> and <rs type="person">Rosina Pepita,\r\n                  a dancer,</rs> <lb/>father unknown, but reputed a gipsy, mother also un-<lb break="no"/>known but\r\n               reputed a seller of old iron in the market-<lb break="no"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center"\r\n                  n="132">132</fw>\r\n               <pb n="133"/>\r\n               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n               <lb/>place over against the <rs type="place">Galata Bridge</rs>. The secretaries <lb/>looked at each other\r\n               in dismay. And still <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> slept. <lb/>Morning and evening they watched him, but,\r\n               save that <lb/>his breathing was regular and his cheeks still flushed <lb/>their\r\n               habitual deep rose, he gave no sign of life. What-<lb break="no"/>ever science or ingenuity\r\n               could do to waken him they <lb/>did. But still he slept. </p>\r\n            <p>On the seventh day of his trance (<date>Thursday, May the <lb/>10th</date>) the first shot was\r\n               fired of that terrible and bloody <lb/>insurrection of which <rs type="person" key="JFB">Lieutenant Brigge</rs> had\r\n               detected <lb/>the first symptoms. <orgName>The Turks</orgName> rose against <rs type="person">the Sultan</rs>, <lb/>set fire to\r\n               the town, and put every foreigner they could <lb/>find, either to the sword or to the\r\n               bastinado. A few Eng-<lb break="no"/>lish managed to escape; but, as might have been ex-\r\n               <lb/>pected, the <orgName>gentlemen of the British Embassy</orgName> preferred <lb/>to die in defence of\r\n               their red boxes, or, in extreme cases, <lb/>to swallow bunches of keys rather than\r\n               let them fall into <lb/>the hands of <orgName>the Infidel</orgName>.The rioters broke into <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs>’s\r\n               <lb/>room, but seeing him stretched to all appearance dead <lb/>they left him\r\n               untouched, and only robbed him of his <lb/>coronet and the robes of the Garter. </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n               <lb/>And now again obscurity descends, and would indeed <lb/>that it were deeper!\r\n               Would, we almost have it in our <lb/>hearts to exclaim, that it were so deep that we\r\n               could see <lb/>nothing whatever through its opacity!

But here, alas, Truth, Candour, and\r\n               Honesty, <lb/>the austere Gods who keep watch and ward by the ink-<lb break="no"/>pot of the\r\n               biographer, cry No! Putting their silver trum-<lb break="no"/>pets to their lips they demand in\r\n               one blast, Truth! And <lb/>again they cry Truth! and sounding yet a third time in\r\n               <lb/>concert they peal forth, The Truth and nothing but the <lb/>Truth! </p>\r\n            <p>At which – Heaven be praised! for it affords us a <lb/>breathing space – the doors\r\n               gently open, as if a breath <lb/>of the gentlest and holiest zephyr had wafted them\r\n               apart, <lb/>and three figures enter. First, comes <rs>our Lady of Purity</rs>; <lb/>whose\r\n               brows are bound with fillets of the whitest lamb’s <lb/>wool; whose hair is<app n="23"><lem> </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1"> as </rdg></app>an\r\n               avalanche of the driven snow; <lb/>and in whose hand reposes the white quill of a\r\n               virgin <lb/>goose. Following her, but with a statelier step, comes <lb/><rs>our Lady of\r\n               Chastity</rs>; on whose brow is set like a turret <lb/>of burning but unwasting fire a\r\n               diadem of icicles; her <lb/>eyes are pure stars, and her fingers, if they touch you,\r\n              <lb/>freeze you to the bone. Close behind her, sheltering in-<lb break="no"/>deed in the shadow\r\n               of her more stately sisters, comes <rs>our <lb/>Lady of Modesty</rs>, frailest and fairest of\r\n               the three; whose <lb/>face is only shown as the young moon shows when it is <lb/>thin\r\n               and sickle shaped and half hidden among clouds. <lb/>Each advances towards the centre\r\n               of the room where <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="134">134</fw>\r\n               <pb n="135"/>\r\n               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n               <lb/><rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> still lies sleeping; and with gestures at once ap-<lb break="no"/>pealing and\r\n               commanding, <rs><emph rend="italics">Our Lady of Purity</emph></rs> speaks <lb/>first: <br\r\n                  rend="indent"/><q type="spoken">“I am the guardian of the sleeping fawn; the snow is <lb/>dear to\r\n               me; and the moon rising; and the silver sea.

The <lb/>room was in some disorder, his coronet having\r\n                    rolled <lb/>on the floor, and his cloak and garter being flung all <lb/>of a\r\n                    heap on a chair. The table was littered with <lb/>papers. No suspicion was felt\r\n                    at first, as the fatigues <lb/>of the night had been great. But when afternoon\r\n                    <lb/>came and he still slept, a doctor was summoned. <lb/>He applied remedies\r\n                    which had been used on the <lb/>previous occasion, plasters, nettles, emetics,\r\n                    etc., but <lb/>without success. <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> slept on.\r\n                    His secretaries <pb n="122"/>\r\n                    <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="left" n="122">122</fw>  <fw type="header"\r\n                        rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n                    <lb/>then thought it their duty to examine the papers on the <lb/>table.

There <lb/>were also various state papers and others of a private\r\n                    <lb/>nature concerning the management of his estates in <lb/><rs type="place"><country>England</country></rs>. But at\r\n                    length they came upon a document <lb/>of far greater significance. It was\r\n                    nothing less, in-<lb break="no"/>deed, than a deed of marriage, drawn up, signed, <lb/>and\r\n                    witnessed between <rs type="person" key="OrM">his Lordship,\r\n                        Orlando, Knight <lb/>of the Garter, <app n="21"><lem>etc., etc.,</lem> <rdg wit="#US1">etc. etc.</rdg></app>\r\n                        etc.,</rs> and <rs type="person"><rs type="person">Rosina Pepita</rs>, <lb/>a\r\n                        dancer</rs>, father unknown, but reputed a gipsy, <lb/>mother also unknown\r\n                    but reputed a seller of old iron <lb/>in the market-place over against the\r\n                    Galata Bridge. <lb/>The secretaries looked at each other in dismay.

', '<h5> Variants </h5>\r\n<p>I have used Juxta for initial comparison of the texts, but it is somewhat problematic using traditional collation tools when the two editions are printed from different typesets. The US edition has been typeset in the US (see link copyright), while the UK edition is typeset for Hogarth Press in the UK. This leads to the collation being somewhat thrown off by things like line breaks, page numbers, and particularly line break hyphens. Juxta reads "drinking" and "drink-ing" as two different words, making it difficult to run any kind of automatic collation on these two editions, particularly as the US edition has a particular high amount of linebreaks. A careful, manual readthrough of the collation results in Juxta has, however, resulted in discovering several significant differences between the two editions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This variants have been marked up in the same way Juxta marks up variants from two or more external witnesses, rather than locally defined variant readings or spellings: using the element &lt;app&gt; with child elements &lt;lem&gt; and &lt;rdg&gt; to define the other edition''s reading. &lt;rdg&gt; gets the attribute "wit" to define which external witness the variant originates from. This may seem superfluous in a collation/parallell text consisting only of two readings, but the benefit of this type of markup, which is essentially a hard coding of proof read collation results, is that it can easily be extended to include any further witnesses which may be added to the electronic edition at a future date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding the readings from both editions has meant a certain customisation of the output has been necessary, to specify that text within &lt;lem&gt; should be output, while text within &lt;rdg&gt; should not, and is merely part of the underlying markup. A benefit of using existing TEI rather than a customised schema is of course that existing stylesheets exist for this kind of output.<p>\r\n\r\nThe variants can be seen in the <strong><a href="?node=content&id=120"> parallel text viewer</a></strong>.', '', '', '2014-04-25 17:03:40', ''),
(111, 'Why Orlando?', 'A rationale for this edition.', '<h5>A rationale for this edition </h5>\r\n<p>The initial rationale for undertaking this edition was simply that, after some research (later confirmed by Mark Hussey) that no authoritative digital text of <i>Orlando</i> seemed to be in existence, nor underway, and supported by the purely practical concern that Loyola’s library contained two of three first editions of the novel. Digital texts were, of course, available, notably <a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91o/">this edition produced by University of Adelaide</a> and the <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200331.txt">Gutenberg Project Australia</a>’s version. (Notably, they both seem to be using, based on textual variants, the US edition as their base text, though neither specify). But scholarly editions, not so much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the edition was undertaken, further affordances of a digital edition gradually were added. Particularly the decision to mark up the text in TEI was a choice made not only to increase the affordances of the text, but also to explore the use of TEI as annotation. Not only the contrast and similarities to TEI as annotation with traditional print annotation, but also the question of whether or not TEI annotation influences readings and use of the text more or less than the footnotes and critical apparatus of a traditional edition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The choice to use TEI was further confirmed by the particular nature of the text - the gender fluidity of the eponymous protagonist, which comes to a point in the chosen chapter, chapter 3. A further motivation was a desire to explore how to handle things like characters with more than one gender identity as well as non-linear and unreliable chronology in fiction using TEI, and the lack or not of influence these decisions may have on a reading or study using this edition. Particularly my own previous work on gender identity and sexuality in Woolf has informed my decision to make the TEI markup a significant part of this edition, rather than making it simply a two edition digital facsimile with a parallel searchable text. More on this <a href="http://digitalorlando.wordpress.com/gender/tei-politics/">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploring not only previous works and projects using TEI such as INSERT, but also theoretical explorations of the electronic edition as a scholarly edition I have been motivated by a strong conviction of the affordances the digital medium presents for researches and scholars, and the need for authoritative digital texts of seminal works such as Orlando. The digital facsimiles of the two first editions, furthermore, make these first versions of the text immediately available, supporting a study of the history of the text, and making available the version <i>Orlando</i>’s first readership were confronted with. By putting this in direct context with the first receptions of the novel, as well as loosely connected to a wider critical apparatus, this edition seeks to enhance the understanding of <em>Orlando</em>''s history. </p>', '', '', '2014-04-07 06:27:38', ''),

(New York, 1928)</a> </li>\r\n</ul> \r\n\r\n<p>As the library records suggest and as Loyola Archivist Kathy Young has confirmed, these are the first imprint of the British edition, published on Oct 11th 1928, and the first imprint of the US Trade or Regular edition, published on October 18th 1928. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite their relative statuses as first UK and US regular editions, neither of the editions digitised were the first version of <i>Orlando</i> to appear. 9 days before the first UK edition from the Woolfs'' own Hogarth Press, a special limited edition was published in New York by Crosby & Gaige. It is a possibility that this was done to circumvent 20th century US copyright laws with regards to foreign materials, which stipulated that for any foreign work to be within copyright by the published in the US, it must be typeset in the United States, and published in the United States prior to foreign publication. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Shillingsburg has suggested this as a reason for the similar publication pattern of the first US and UK editions of Woolf''s <i>To The Lighthouse</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is worth making note of the correspondance between the final date of the novel (October 11th 1928) with the publication of the Hogarth Press first edition, suggesting this is, indeed, the "true" first edition. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Crosby & Gaige edition was typeset from type proofs printed by R & R Clark in Edinburgh, and corrected by Woolf before being sent to New York. These proofs were not used for the UK edition, for which no type proofs survive. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plates used for the Crosby & Gaige edition were then used for printing the Harcourt, Brace & co., edition, which means that though this project does not have access to images of the limited \r\nUS edition, the mark-up and text will generally speaking be similar for the the two US editions. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The corrected type proofs have kindly been photo copied by Karen Kukil at the Mortimer Rare Book Room at Smith College, and have been temporarily included in this project. Karen, and Alison Scott in her article "Tantalising Fragments" have indicated that <i>Orlando,</i> is that of Woolf''s novels she edited the most in the span from type proof to final typeset, and though this chapter is not the most heavily marked, it shows active revision by the author. </p> ', '', '', '2014-04-17 01:45:35', ''),

Despite it''s limitations, which are discussed in this project''s <a href="http://www.digitalorlando.wordpress.com"><strong> Companion Site</strong> </a>, it is still the obvious choice for any textual scholar. Specific issues with marking up <i>Orlando</i> are brought up in the companion paper, but the most specifically complicated issue was of course that of Orlando''s gender.</p>\r\n<p>Though the TEI guidelines have recently been expanded from offering simply the gender binaries "male" and "female" [include link to appropriate guideline section], there is still not an easy way to mark one person to be of two or more genders within the same text without removing the purpose of marking up the gender. The <sex> tag as outlined in P5 is only permissable in the listPerson element, which again is only permissable in the TEI header. This means that there is no obvious way, or even "legal" way to mark up a mid-text gender shift. </p>\r\n \r\n<p> I have chosen to circumvent this issue by creating two keys for Orlando''s character throughout - OrM and OrW. These are then both included in the persList element in the header. Though this allows me to change the sex attached to Orlando''s character midway through Chapter 3, BUT sadly it indicates that Orlando also turns into a different person, with different characteristics and traits, which of course is not the case. </p> \r\n\r\n<p> One obvious other way to circumvent the gender assignment issues of TEI is to write a separate schema for <i>Orlando</i>. However, this project was in part an exploration into using TEI for modernist fiction markup, and whether it''s affordances outweigh it''s limitations, and if it''s status as the default Humanities/Textual Studies XML language is justified.

The malady is too well known, <lb/>and has been, alas,\r\n               too often described to need describing <lb/>afresh, save very briefly. There were\r\n               mountains; there were <lb/>valleys; there were streams. She climbed the mountains;\r\n               <lb/>roamed the valleys; sat on the banks of the streams. She <lb/>likened the hills\r\n               to ramparts, <app n="40"><lem>and the plains to the</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">to the breasts of doves, and the</rdg></app> flanks <lb/>of kine.

Everything, in fact, was some-<lb break="no"/>thing else. She\r\n               found the tarn on the mountain-top and <lb/>almost threw herself in to seek the\r\n               wisdom she thought <lb/>lay hid there; and when, from the mountain-top, she\r\n               <lb/><app n="41"><lem>beheld, far</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">beheld far</rdg></app> off, across <geogName type="sea">the Sea of Marmara</geogName><app n="42"><lem> the</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">, the</rdg></app> plains of <lb/><rs type="place"><country>Greece</country></rs>, and made\r\n               out (her eyes were admirable) the <rs type="place"><lb/>Acropolis</rs> with a white streak or two which\r\n               must, she <lb/>thought, be the <rs type="place">Parthenon</rs>, her soul expanded with her <lb/>eyeballs,\r\n               and she prayed that she might share the maj-<lb break="no"/>esty of the hills, know the\r\n               serenity of the plains, etc., etc., <lb/>as all such believers do.

Returning home, she\r\n               <lb/>saluted each star, each peak, and each watch-fire as if <lb/>they signalled to\r\n               her alone; and at last, when she flung <lb/>herself upon her mat in the gipsies’\r\n               tent, she could not <lb/>help bursting out again, How good to eat! How good to\r\n               <lb/>eat! (For it is a curious fact that though human beings <lb/>have such imperfect\r\n               means of communication, that they <lb/>can only say ‘good to eat’ when they mean\r\n               ‘beautiful’ and <lb/>the other way about, they will yet endure ridicule and\r\n               <lb/>misunderstanding rather than keep any experience to <lb/>themselves.) All the\r\n                  young gipsies laughed. But <rs type="person" key="RES">Rus-<lb break="no"/>tum el Sadi</rs>, the old man who had brought <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs>\r\n               out <lb/>of <rs type="place"><settlement type="city">Constantinople</settlement></rs> on his donkey, sat silent.

He had the deepest suspicion <lb/>that her God was\r\n               Nature. One day, he found her in <lb/>tears. Interpreting this to mean that her God\r\n               had pun-<lb break="no"/>ished her, he told her that he was not surprised. He <lb/>showed her\r\n               the fingers of his left hand, withered by the <lb/>frost; he showed her his right\r\n               foot, crushed where a rock <lb/>had fallen. This, he said, was what her God did to\r\n               men. <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="144">144</fw>\r\n               <pb n="145"/>\r\n               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n               <lb/>When she said, <q type="spoken"> “But so beautiful,”</q> using the English <lb/>word, he shook his\r\n               head; and when she repeated it he <lb/>was angry. He saw that she did not believe\r\n               what he be-<lb break="no"/>lieved, and that was enough, wise and ancient as he was, <lb/>to\r\n               enrage him.</p>\r\n            <p>This difference of opinion disturbed <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs>, who <lb/>had been perfectly happy until\r\n               now. She began to think, <lb/>was Nature beautiful or cruel; and then she asked\r\n               herself <lb/>what this beauty was; whether it was in things them-<lb break="no"/>selves, or\r\n               only in herself; so she went on to the nature of <lb/>reality, which led her to\r\n               truth, which in its turn, led to <lb/>Love, Friendship, Poetry (as in the days on the\r\n               high <lb/>mound at home) which meditations, since she could im-<lb break="no"/>part no word of\r\n               them, made her long, as she had never <lb/>longed before, for pen and ink. </p>\r\n            <p><q type="spoken">“Oh! if only I could write !”</q> she cried (for she had the <lb/>odd conceit of those\r\n               who write that words written are <lb/>shared). She had no ink; and but little paper.\r\n               But she <lb/>made ink from berries and wine; and finding a few <lb/>margins and blank\r\n               spaces in the manuscript of “The Oak <lb/>Tree,” managed, by writing a kind of\r\n               <app n="43"><lem>shorthand </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">shorthand, </rdg></app> to de-<lb break="no"/>scribe the scenery in a long, blank <app n="44"><lem>verse</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">version</rdg></app> poem, and to\r\n               <lb/>carry on a dialogue with herself about this Beauty and <lb/>Truth concisely\r\n               enough. This kept her extremely happy <lb/>for hours on end. But <orgName>the gipsies</orgName> became\r\n               suspicious. <lb/>First, they noticed that she was less adept than before at <lb/><fw\r\n                  type="pageNum" rend="center" n="145">145</fw>\r\n               <pb n="146"/>\r\n               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n               <lb/>milking and cheese-making; next, she often hesitated <lb/>before replying; and\r\n               once a gipsy boy who had been <lb/>asleep, woke in a terror feeling her eyes upon\r\n               him. Some-<lb break="no"/>times this constraint would be felt by the whole tribe, <lb/>numbering\r\n               some dozens of grown men and women. It <lb/>sprang from the sense they had (and their\r\n               senses are very <lb/>sharp and much in advance of their vocabulary) that\r\n               <lb/>whatever they were doing crumbled like ashes in their <lb/>hands. An old woman\r\n               making a basket, a boy skinning <lb/>a sheep, would be singing or crooning\r\n               contentedly at <lb/>their work, when <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> would come into the camp, <lb/>fling\r\n               herself down by the fire and gaze into the flames. <lb/>She need not even look at\r\n               them, and yet they felt, here <lb/>is someone who doubts; (we make a rough-and-ready\r\n               <lb/>translation from the gipsy language) here is someone <lb/>who does not do the\r\n               thing for the sake of doing; nor <lb/>looks for looking’s sake; here is someone who\r\n               believes <lb/>neither in sheep-skin nor basket; but sees (here they <lb/>looked\r\n               apprehensively about the tent) something else. <lb/>Then a vague but most unpleasant\r\n               feeling would begin to <lb/>work in the boy and in the old woman. They broke their\r\n               <lb/>withys; they cut their fingers. A great rage filled them. <lb/>They wished\r\n               <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> would leave the tent and never <lb/>come near them again. Yet she was of a\r\n               cheerful and <lb/>willing disposition, they owned; and one of her pearls <lb/>was\r\n               enough to buy the finest herd of goats in <rs type="place">Broussa</rs>.</p>\r\n            <lb/>\r\n            <fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="146">146</fw>\r\n            <pb n="147"/>\r\n            <lb/>\r\n            <fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n            <p>Slowly, she began to feel that there was some differ-<lb break="no"/>ence between her and <orgName>the\r\n               gipsies</orgName> which made her hesi-<lb break="no"/>tate sometimes to marry and settle down among them\r\n               <lb/>for ever. At first she tried to account for it by saying that <lb/>she came of\r\n               an ancient and civilised race, whereas these <lb/>gipsies were an ignorant people,\r\n               not much better than <lb/>savages. One night when they were questioning her\r\n               <lb/>about <rs type="place"><country>England</country></rs> she could not help with some pride de-<lb break="no"/>scribing the house\r\n               where she was born, how it had 365 <lb/>bedrooms and had been in the possession of\r\n               her family <lb/>for four or five hundred years. Her ancestors were earls, <lb/>or\r\n               even dukes, she added. At this she noticed again that <lb/>the gipsies were uneasy;\r\n               but not angry as before when <lb/>she had praised the beauty of nature. Now they were\r\n               <lb/>courteous, but concerned as people of fine breeding are <lb/>when a stranger has\r\n               been made to reveal his low birth or <lb/>poverty. <rs type="person" key="RES">Rustum</rs> followed her out of the\r\n               tent alone and <lb/>said that she need not mind if her father were a Duke, <lb/>and\r\n               possessed all the bedrooms and furniture that she <lb/>described. They would none of\r\n               them think the worse of <lb/>her for that. Then she was seized with a shame that she\r\n               <lb/>had never felt before. It was clear that <rs type="person" key="RES">Rustum</rs> and the <lb/>other gipsies\r\n               thought a descent of four or five hundred <lb/>years only the meanest possible. Their\r\n               own families went <lb/>back at least two or three thousand years.

And then, though he was too courteous to speak\r\n               <lb/>openly, it was clear that <rs type="person" key="RES">the gipsy</rs> thought that there was <lb/>no more vulgar\r\n               ambition than to possess bedrooms by <lb/>the hundred (they were on top of a hill as\r\n               they spoke; it <lb/>was night; the mountains rose around them) when the <lb/>whole\r\n               earth is ours. Looked at from the gipsy point of <lb/>view, a Duke, <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs>\r\n               understood, was nothing but a <lb/>profiteer or robber who snatched land and money\r\n               from <lb/>people who rated these things of little worth, and could <lb/>think of\r\n               nothing better to do than to build three hun-<lb break="no"/>dred and sixty-five bedrooms when\r\n               one was enough, and <lb/>none was even better than one. She could not deny <lb/>that\r\n               her ancestors had accumulated field after field; <lb/>house after house; honour after\r\n               honour; yet had none <lb/>of them been saints or heroes, or great benefactors of\r\n               <lb/>the human race. Nor could she counter the argument <lb/>(<rs type="person" key="RES">Rustum</rs> was too much of\r\n               a gentleman to press it, but <lb/>she understood) that any man who did now what her\r\n               an-<lb break="no"/>cestors had done three or four hundred years ago would <lb/>be\r\n               denounced——and by her own family most loudly <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center"\r\n                  n="148">148</fw>\r\n               <pb n="149"/>\r\n               \r\n               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n               <lb/>——for a vulgar upstart, an adventurer, a <emph rend="italics">nouveau\r\n                  riche.</emph>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>She sought to answer such arguments by the familiar <lb/>if oblique method of finding\r\n               the Gipsy life itself rude <lb/>and barbarous; and so, in a short time, much bad\r\n               blood <lb/>was bred between them.

First, she carefully examined the papers <lb/>on the table;\r\n                    took such as seemed to be written in <lb/>poetry, and secreted them in her\r\n                    bosom; next she <lb/>called her Seleuchi hound, which had never left <lb/>her\r\n                    bed all these days, though half famished with <lb/>hunger, fed and combed him;\r\n                    then stuck a pair of <lb/>pistols in her belt; finally wound about her person\r\n                    <lb/>several strings of emeralds and pearls of the finest <lb/>orient which had\r\n                    formed part of her Ambassadorial <lb/>wardrobe.

The sky good to\r\n                    eat, indeed! The <lb/>elders, however, who had seen more of foreigners than\r\n                    <lb/>they had, became suspicious. They noticed that <lb/><rs type="person" key="OrW"\r\n                        >Orlando</rs> often sat for whole hours doing nothing <lb/>whatever,\r\n                    except look here and then there; they would <lb/>come upon her on some hill-top\r\n                    staring straight in <lb/>front of her, no matter whether the goats were grazing\r\n                    <lb/>or straying. They began to suspect that she had other <lb/>beliefs than\r\n                    their <app n="36"><lem>own,</lem> <rdg wit="#US1">own</rdg></app> and the <app n="37"><lem>older</lem> <rdg wit="#US1">elder</rdg></app> men and women <lb/>thought it probable that she had\r\n                    fallen into the clutches <lb/>of the vilest and <app n="38"><lem>cruellest</lem> <rdg wit="#US1">cruelest</rdg></app> among all the Gods,\r\n                    which <lb/>is Nature. Nor were they far wrong. The English <lb/>disease, a love\r\n                    of Nature, was inborn in her, and <app n="39"><lem>here, <lb/>where</lem> <rdg wit="#US1">here where</rdg></app> Nature was so much larger and\r\n                    more powerful <lb/>than in England, she fell into its hands as she had never\r\n                    <lb/>done before. The malady is too well known, and has <lb/>been, alas, too\r\n                    often described to need describing <lb/>afresh, save very briefly. There were\r\n                    mountains; <lb/>there were valleys; there were streams. She climbed <lb/>the\r\n                    mountains; roamed the valleys; sat on the banks <lb/>of the streams. She likened\r\n                    the hills to ramparts, <lb/><app n="40"><lem>to the breasts of doves, and the</lem> <rdg wit="#US1">and the plains to the</rdg></app> flanks of kine.\r\n                    <lb/>She compared the flowers to enamel and the turf <lb/>to Turkey rugs worn\r\n                    thin. Trees were withered <lb/>hags, and sheep were grey boulders. Everything,\r\n                    in <lb/>fact, was something else. She found the tarn on the <lb/>mountain-top\r\n                    and almost threw herself in to seek the <lb/>wisdom she thought lay hid there;\r\n                    and when, from the <lb/>mountain-top, she <app n="41"><lem>beheld far</lem> <rdg wit="#US1">beheld, far</rdg></app> off, across the \r\n                    <rs type="place" type="sea">the Sea of <lb/>Marmara</rs><app n="42"><lem>, the</lem> <rdg wit="#US1"> the</rdg></app> plains of <rs type="place"><country>Greece</country></rs>, and made out (her eyes <pb n="132"/>\r\n                    <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="left" n="132">132</fw>  <fw type="header"\r\n                        rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n                    <lb/>were admirable) the <rs type="place">Acropolis</rs> with a white streak or <lb/>two which must,\r\n                    she thought, be the <rs type="place">Parthenon</rs>, her <lb/>soul expanded with her eyeballs, and she\r\n                    prayed that <lb/>she might share the majesty of the hills, know the\r\n                    <lb/>serenity of the plains, <app n="43"><lem>etc.</lem> <rdg wit="#US1">etc.,</rdg></app> etc., as all such believers do. <lb/>Then,\r\n                    looking down, the red hyacinth, the purple iris <lb/>wrought her to cry out in\r\n                    ecstasy at the goodness, the <lb/>beauty of nature; raising her eyes again, she\r\n                    beheld <lb/>the eagle soaring, and imagined its raptures and made <lb/>them her\r\n                    own. Returning home, she saluted each <lb/>star, each peak, and each watch-fire\r\n                    as if they signalled <lb/>to her alone; and at last, when she flung herself upon\r\n                    <lb/>her mat in the gipsies’ tent, she could not help bursting <lb/>out again,\r\n                    How good to eat! How good to eat! (For <lb/>it is a curious fact that though\r\n                    human beings have such <lb/>imperfect means of communication, that they can only\r\n                    <lb/>say ’good to eat’ when they mean ’beautiful’ and <lb/>the other way about,\r\n                    they will yet endure ridicule and <lb/>misunderstanding rather than keep any\r\n                    experience to <lb/>themselves.) All the young gipsies laughed. But <lb/><rs\r\n                        type="person">Rustum el Sadi</rs>, the old man who had brought <rs type="person"\r\n                        key="OrW">Orlando</rs>\r\n                    <lb/>out of <rs type="place">Constantinople</rs> on his donkey, sat silent. He\r\n                    <lb/>had a nose like a scimitar; his cheeks were furrowed as <lb/>if from the\r\n                    age-long descent of iron hail; he was brown <lb/>and keen—eyed, and as he sat\r\n                    tugging at his hookah <lb/>he observed <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs>\r\n                    narrowly. He had the deepest <lb/>suspicion that her God was Nature. One day he\r\n                    <lb/>found her in tears. Interpreting this to mean that her <lb/>God had\r\n                    punished her, he told her that he was not <lb/>surprised. He showed her the\r\n                    fingers of his left hand, <lb/>withered by the frost; he showed her his right\r\n                    foot, <pb n="133"/>\r\n                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>  <fw type="pageNum" rend="right"\r\n                        n="133">133</fw>\r\n                    <lb/>crushed where a rock had fallen. This, he said, was <lb/>what her God did\r\n                    to men. When she said, <q type="spoken">“But so <lb/>beautiful”</q>, using the\r\n                    English word, he shook his head; <lb/>and when she repeated it he was angry. He\r\n                    saw that <lb/>she did not believe what he believed, and that was <lb/>enough,\r\n                    wise and ancient as he was, to enrage him.</p>\r\n                <p>This difference of opinion disturbed <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs>, who\r\n                    <lb/>had been perfectly happy until now. She began to <lb/>think, was Nature\r\n                    beautiful or cruel; and then she <lb/>asked herself what this beauty was;\r\n                    whether it was <lb/>in things themselves, or only in herself; so she went\r\n                    <lb/>on to the nature of reality, which led her to truth, <lb/>which in its turn\r\n                    led to Love, Friendship, Poetry <lb/>(as in the days on the high mound at\r\n                    home); which <lb/>meditations, since she could impart no word of them, <lb/>made\r\n                    her long, as she had never longed before, for <lb/>pen and ink.</p>\r\n                <p><q type="spoken">“Oh! if only I could write!”</q> she cried (for she <lb/>had the\r\n                    odd conceit of those who write that words <lb/>written are shared). She had no\r\n                    ink; and but little <lb/>paper. But she made ink from berries and wine; <lb/>and\r\n                    finding a few margins and blank spaces in the <lb/>manuscript of "The Oak Tree",\r\n                    managed, by writing <lb/>a kind of shorthand, to describe the scenery in a long,\r\n                    <lb/>blank <app n="44"><lem>version</lem> <rdg wit="#US1">verse</rdg></app> poem, and to carry on a dialogue with <lb/>herself about this\r\n                    Beauty and Truth concisely enough. <lb/>This kept her extremely happy for hours\r\n                    on end. But <lb/>the gipsies became suspicious. First, they noticed that\r\n                    <lb/>she was less adept than before at milking and cheese-<lb break="no"/>making; next,\r\n                    she often hesitated before replying; <lb/>and once a gipsy boy who had been\r\n                    asleep, woke in <pb n="134"/>\r\n                    <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="left" n="134">134</fw>  <fw type="header"\r\n                        rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n                    <lb/>a terror feeling her eyes upon him. Sometimes this <lb/>constraint would be\r\n                    felt by the whole tribe, numbering <lb/>some dozens of grown men and women. It\r\n                    sprang <lb/>from the sense they had (and their senses are very <lb/>sharp and\r\n                    much in advance of their vocabulary) that <lb/>whatever they were doing crumbled\r\n                    like ashes in their <lb/>hands. An old woman making a basket, a boy\r\n                    <lb/>skinning a sheep, would be singing or crooning con-<lb break="no"/>tentedly at their\r\n                    work, when <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> would come <lb/>into the camp,\r\n                    fling herself down by the fire and <lb/>gaze into the flames. She need not even\r\n                    look at them, <lb/>and yet they felt, here is someone who doubts; (we <lb/>make\r\n                    a rough-and-ready translation from the gipsy <lb/>language) here is someone who\r\n                    does not do the thing <lb/>for the sake of doing; nor looks for looking’s sake;\r\n                    <lb/>here is someone who believes neither in sheep—skin <lb/>nor basket; but\r\n                    sees (here they looked apprehensively <lb/>about the tent) something else. Then\r\n                    a vague but <lb/>most unpleasant feeling would begin to work in the <lb/>boy and\r\n                    in the old woman. They broke their <lb/>withys; they cut their fingers. A great\r\n                    rage filled <lb/>them. They wished <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> would\r\n                    leave the tent <lb/>and never come near them again. Yet she was of <lb/>a\r\n                    cheerful and willing disposition, they owned; and <lb/>one of her pearls was\r\n                    enough to buy the finest herd of <lb/>goats in Broussa.</p>\r\n                <p>Slowly, she began to feel that there was some <lb/>difference between her and the\r\n                    gipsies which made <lb/>her hesitate sometimes to marry and settle down among\r\n                    <lb/>them for ever. At first she tried to account for it by <lb/>saying that she\r\n                    came of an ancient and civilised race, <pb n="135"/>\r\n                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>  <fw type="pageNum" rend="right"\r\n                        n="135">135</fw>\r\n                    <lb/>whereas these gipsies were an ignorant people, not <lb/>much better than\r\n                    savages. One night when they were <lb/>questioning her about\r\n                        <rs type="place">England</rs> she could not help <lb/>with some pride\r\n                    describing the house where she was <lb/>born, how it had 365 bedrooms and had\r\n                    been in the <lb/>possession of her family for four or five hundred years.\r\n                    <lb/>Her ancestors were earls, or even dukes, she added. <lb/>At this she\r\n                    noticed again that the gipsies were uneasy; <lb/>but not angry as before when\r\n                    she had praised the <lb/>beauty of nature. Now they were courteous, but\r\n                    <lb/>concerned as people of fine breeding are when a <lb/>stranger has been made\r\n                    to reveal his low birth or <lb/>poverty. <rs type="person">Rustum</rs> followed\r\n                    her out of the tent alone <lb/>and said that she need not mind if her father\r\n                    were a <lb/>Duke, and possessed all the bedrooms and furniture <lb/>that she\r\n                    described. They would none of them think <lb/>the worse of her for that. Then\r\n                    she was seized with <lb/>a shame that she had never felt before. It was clear\r\n                    <lb/>that <rs type="person">Rustum</rs> and the other gipsies thought a descent\r\n                    <lb/>of four or five hundred years only the meanest possible. <lb/>Their own\r\n                    families went back at least two or three <lb/>thousand years. To the gipsy whose\r\n                    ancestors had <lb/>built the Pyramids centuries before Christ was born, <lb/>the\r\n                    genealogy of Howards and Plantagenets was no <lb/>better and no worse than that\r\n                    of the Smiths and <lb/>the ]oneses: both were negligible. Moreover, where\r\n                    <lb/>the shepherd boy had a lineage of such antiquity, <lb/>there was nothing\r\n                    specially memorable or desirable <lb/>in ancient birth; vagabonds and beggars\r\n                    all shared <lb/>it. And then, though he was too courteous to speak <lb/>openly,\r\n                    it was clear that the gipsy thought that there <pb n="136"/>\r\n                    <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="left" n="136">136</fw>  <fw type="header"\r\n                        rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n                    <lb/>was no more vulgar ambition than to possess bedrooms <lb/>by the hundred\r\n                    (they were on top of a hill as they <lb/>spoke; it was night; the mountains rose\r\n                    around them) <lb/>when the whole earth is ours. Looked at from the <lb/>gipsy\r\n                    point of view, a Duke, <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> understood,\r\n                    <lb/>was nothing but a profiteer or robber who snatched <lb/>land and money from\r\n                    people who rated these things <lb/>of little worth, and could think of nothing\r\n                    better to <lb/>do than to build three hundred and sixty-five bed-<lb break="no"/>rooms\r\n                    when one was enough, and none was even better <lb/>than one. She could not deny\r\n                    that her ancestors <lb/>had accumulated field after field; house after house;\r\n                    <lb/>honour after honour; yet had none of them been saints <lb/>or heroes, or\r\n                    great benefactors of the human race. <lb/>Nor could she counter the argument\r\n                        (<rs type="person">Rustum</rs> was too <lb/>much of a gentleman to press it,\r\n                    but she understood) <lb/>that any man who did now what her ancestors had done\r\n                    <lb/>three or four hundred years ago would be denounced <lb/>——and by her own\r\n                    family most loudly——for a vulgar <lb/>upstart, an adventurer, a <emph\r\n                        rend="italics">nouveau riche</emph>.</p>\r\n                <p>She sought to answer such arguments by the <lb/>familiar if oblique method of\r\n                    finding the gipsy life <lb/>itself rude and barbarous; and so, in a short time,\r\n                    <lb/>much bad blood was bred between them. Indeed, <lb/>such differences of\r\n                    opinion are enough to cause blood-<lb break="no"/>shed and revolution. Towns have been\r\n                    sacked for <lb/>less, and a million martyrs have suffered at the stake\r\n                    <lb/>rather than yield an inch upon any of the points here <lb/>debated. No\r\n                    passion is stronger in the breast of man <lb/>than the desire to make others\r\n                    believe as he believes. <lb/>Nothing so cuts at the root of his happiness and\r\n                    fills <pb n="137"/>\r\n                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>  <fw type="pageNum" rend="right"\r\n                        n="137">137</fw>\r\n                    <lb/>him with rage as the sense that another rates low what <lb/>he prizes high.\r\n                    Whigs and Tories, Liberal party and <lb/>Labour party——for what do they battle\r\n                    except their <lb/>own prestige? It is not love of truth but desire to\r\n                    <lb/>prevail that sets quarter against quarter and makes <lb/>parish desire the\r\n                    downfall of parish.

So she <lb/>was thinking, one\r\n                    fine morning on the slopes of Mount <lb/>Athos, when minding her goats. And then\r\n                    Nature, <lb/>in whom she trusted, either played her a trick or <lb/>worked a\r\n                    miracle——again, opinions differ too much for <lb/>it to be possible to say\r\n                    which. <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> was gazing <lb/>rather\r\n                    disconsolately at the steep hill—side in front of her. <lb/>It was now\r\n                    midsummer, and if we must compare the <lb/>landscape to anything, it would have\r\n                    been to a dry <lb/>bone; to a sheep’s skeleton; to a gigantic skull picked\r\n                    <lb/>white by a thousand vultures. The heat was intense, <lb/>and the little <app n="47"><lem>fig\r\n                        tree</lem> <rdg wit="#US1">fig-tree</rdg></app> under which <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> lay only <pb n="138"/>\r\n                    <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="left" n="138">138</fw>  <fw type="header"\r\n                        rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>\r\n                    <lb/>served to print patterns of fig-leaves upon her light <lb/>burnous.</p>\r\n                <p>Suddenly<app n="48"><lem> a</lem> <rdg wit="#US1">, a</rdg></app> shadow, though there was nothing to <lb/>cast a shadow, appeared on\r\n                    the bald mountain-side <lb/>opposite. It deepened quickly and soon a green\r\n                    <lb/>hollow showed where there had been barren rock <lb/>before. As she looked,\r\n                    the hollow deepened and <lb/>widened, and a great park-like space opened in the\r\n                    <lb/>flank of the hill. Within, she could see an undulating <lb/>and grassy\r\n                    lawn; she could see oak trees dotted here <lb/>and there; she could see the\r\n                    thrushes hopping among <lb/>the branches. She could see the deer stepping deli-\r\n                    <lb/>cately from shade to shade, and could even hear the <lb/>hum of insects and\r\n                    the gentle sighs and shivers of a <lb/>summer’s day in\r\n                            <rs type="place"><country>England</country></rs>. After she had gazed\r\n                    en-<lb break="no"/>tranced for some time, snow began falling; soon the <lb/>whole\r\n                    landscape was covered and marked with violet <lb/>shades instead of yellow\r\n                    sunlight. Now she saw <lb/>heavy carts coming along the roads, laden with tree\r\n                    <lb/>trunks, which they were taking, she knew, to be sawn <lb/>for firewood; and\r\n                    then there appeared the roofs and <lb/>belfries and towers and courtyards of her\r\n                    own home. <lb/>The snow was falling steadily, and she could now hear <lb/>the\r\n                    slither and flop which it made as it slid down the <lb/>roof and fell to the\r\n                    ground. The smoke went up from <lb/>a thousand chimneys. All was so clear and\r\n                    minute <lb/>that she could see a daw pecking for worms in the <lb/>snow. Then,\r\n                    gradually, the violet shadows deepened <lb/>and closed over the carts and the\r\n                    lawns and the great <lb/>house itself. All was swallowed up. Now there was\r\n                    <lb/>nothing left of the grassy hollow, and instead of the <pb n="139"/>\r\n                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>  <fw type="pageNum" rend="right"\r\n                        n="139">139</fw>\r\n                    <lb/>green lawns was only the blazing hill-side which a <lb/>thousand vultures\r\n                    seemed to have picked bare. At <lb/>this, she burst into a passion of tears, and\r\n                    striding back <lb/>to the gipsies’ camp, told them that she must sail for\r\n                            <lb/><rs type="place"><country>England</country></rs> the very next\r\n                    day.</p>\r\n                <p>lt was happy for her that she did so. Already the <lb/>young men had plotted her\r\n                    death. Honour, they <lb/>said, demanded it, for she did not think as they did.\r\n                    <lb/>Yet they would have been sorry to cut her throat; and <lb/>welcomed the\r\n                    news of her departure. An English <lb/>merchant ship, as luck would have it, was\r\n                    already under <lb/>sail in the harbour about to return to\r\n                            <rs type="place"><country>England</country></rs>; and <lb/><rs type="person"\r\n                        key="OrW">Orlando</rs>, by breaking off another pearl from her neck—\r\n                    <lb/>lace, not only paid her passage but had some bank <lb/>notes left over in\r\n                    her wallet. These she would have <lb/>liked to present to the gipsies. But they\r\n                    despised <lb/>wealth she knew; and she had to content herself with\r\n                    <lb/>embraces, which on her part were sincere.</p>', '', '2014-04-27 16:00:42', '');
