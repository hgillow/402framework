                <p>It is,indeed, highly unfortunate, and much to be re-<lb/>gretted that at this
                    stage of <persName key="OrM">Orlando</persName>°s career, when <lb/>he played a
                    most important part in the public life of his <lb/>country, we have least
                    information to go upon. We <lb/>know that he discharged his duties to
                    admiration— wit-<lb/>ness his Bath and his Dukedom. We know that he had a
                    <lb/>finger in some of the most delicate negotiations between <lb/>King Charles
                    and the Turks— to that, treaties in the <lb/>vault of the Record Office bear
                    testimony. But the revo- <lb/>lution which broke out during his period of
                    office, and <lb/>the fire which followed, have so damaged or destroyed <lb/>all
                    those papers from which any trustworthy record <lb/>could be drawn, that what we
                    can give is lamentably in- <lb/>complete. Often the paper was scorched a deep
                    brown <lb/>in the middle of the most important sentence. Just when <lb/>we
                    thought to elucidate a secret that has puzzled his- <lb/>torians for a hundred
                    years, there was a hole in the man- <lb/>uscript big enough to put your finger
                    through. We have <lb/>done our best to piece out a meagre summary from the
                    <lb/>charred fragments that remain; but often it has been <lb/>necessary to
                    speculate, to surmise, and even to make use <lb/>of the imagination.</p>

                <fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
                <p>Orlando’s day was passed, it would seem, somewhat <lb/>in this fashion. About
                    seven, he would rise, wrap him <lb/>self in a long Turkish cloak, light a
                    cheroot, and lean his <lb/>elbows on the parapet. Thus he would stand, gazing at
                    <lb/>the city beneath him, apparently entranced. At this hour <lb/>the mist
                    would lie so thick that the domes of Santa Sofia <lb/>and the rest would seem to
                    be afloat; gradually the mist <lb/>would uncover them; the bubbles would be seen
                    to be <lb/>firmly fixed; there would be the river; there the Galata <lb/>Bridge;
                    there the green turbanned pilgrims without eyes <lb/>or noses, begging alms;
                    there the pariah dogs picking up <lb/>offal; there the shawled women; there the
                    innumerable <lb/>donkeys; there men on horses carrying long poles. Soon,
                    <lb/>the whole town would be astir with the cracking of <lb/>whips, the beating
                    of gongs, cryings to prayer, lashing <lb/>of mules, and rattle of brass-bound
                    wheels, while sour <lb/>odours, made from bread fermenting and incense, and
                    <lb/>spice, rose even to the heights of Pera itself and seemed <lb/>the very
                    breath of the strident and multicoloured and <lb/>barbaric population.</p>

                <p>Nothing, he reflected, gazing at the view which was <lb/>now sparkling in the
                    sun, could well be less like the <lb/>counties of Surrey and Kent or the towns
                    of London and <lb/>Tunbridge Wells. To the right and left rose in bald and
                    <lb/>stony prominence the inhospitable Asian mountains, to <lb/>which the arid
                    castle of a robber chief or two might <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center"

                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
                    <lb/>hang; but parsonage there was none, nor manor house, <lb/>nor cottage, nor
                    oak, elm, violet, ivy, or wild eglantine. <lb/>There were no hedges for ferns to
                    grow on, and no <lb/>fields for sheep to graze. The houses were bare and bald
                    <lb/>as egg-shells. That he, who was English root and fibre, <lb/>should yet
                    exult to the depths of his heart in this wild <lb/>panorama, and gaze and gaze
                    at those passes and far <lb/>heights, planning journeys there alone on foot
                    where <lb/>only the goat and shepherd had gone before; should feel <lb/>a
                    passion of affection for the bright, unseasonable flow- <lb/>ers, love the
                    unkempt, pariah dogs beyond even his elk <lb/>hounds at home, and snuff the
                    acrid, sharp smell of the <lb/>streets eagerly into his nostrils, surprised him.
                    He won- <lb/>dered if, in the season of the Crusades, one of his ances-
                    <lb/>tors had taken up with a Circassian peasant woman; <lb/>thought it
                    possible; fancied a certain darkness in his <lb/>complexion; and, going indoors
                    again, withdrew to his <lb/>bath. </p>
                <p>An hour later, properly scented, curled, and anointed <lb/>he would receive
                    visits from secretaries and other high <lb/>officials carrying, one after
                    another, red boxes which <lb/>yielded only to his own golden key. `Within were
                    papers <lb/>of the highest importance, of which only fragments, here <lb/>a
                    flourish, there a seal firmly attached to a piece of burnt <lb/>silk, now
                    remain. Of their contents then, we cannot <lb/>speak, but can only testify that
                    Orlando was kept busy, <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="121">121</fw>
                    <pb n="4"/>
                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
                    <lb/>what with his wax and seals, his various coloured rib- <lb/>bons which had
                    to be diversely attached, his engrossing <lb/>of titles and making of flourishes
                    round capital letters, <lb/>till luncheon came— a splendid meal of perhaps
                    thirty <lb/>courses. </p>
                <p>After luncheon, lackeys announced that his coach and <lb/>six was at the door and
                    he went, preceded by purple <lb/>Janissaries running on foot and waving great
                    ostrich <lb/>feather fans above their heads, to call upon the other
                    <lb/>ambassadors and dignitaries of state. The ceremony was <lb/>always the
                    same. On reaching the courtyard, the Janis- <lb/>saries struck with their fans
                    upon the main portal, which <lb/>immediately flew open revealing a large
                    chamber, splen- <lb/>didly furnished. Here were seated two figures, gener-
                    <lb/>ally of the opposite sexes. Profound bows and curtseys <lb/>were exchanged.
                    In the first room, it was permissible <lb/>only to mention the weather. Having
                    said that it was <lb/>fine or wet, hot or cold, the Ambassador then passed on
                    <lb/>to the next chamber, where again, two figures rose to <lb/>greet him. Here
                    it was only permissible to compare Con- <lb/>stantinople as a place of residence
                    with London; and the <lb/>Ambassador naturally said that he preferred Constanti-
                    <lb/>nople, and his hosts naturally said, though they had not <lb/>seen it, that
                    they preferred London. In the next cham- <lb/>ber, King Charles’s and the
                    Sultan’s healths had to be <lb/>discussed at some length. In the next were
                    discussed the <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="122">122</fw>
                    
                    <pb n="5"/>
                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
                    <lb/>Ambassador’s health and that of his host’s wife, but more <lb/>briefly. In
                    the next the Ambassador complimented his <lb/>host upon his furniture, and the
                    host complimented the <lb/>Ambassador upon his dress. ln the next, sweet meats
                    <lb/>were offered, the host deploring their badness, the Am- <lb/>bassador
                    extolling their goodness. The ceremony ended <lb/>at length with the smoking of
                    a hookah and the drink- <lb/>ing of a glass of coffee; but though the motions of
                    smok- <lb/>ing and drinking were gone through punctiliously there <lb/>was
                    neither tobacco in the pipe nor coffee in the glass, <lb/>as, had either smoke
                    or drink been real, the human frame <lb/>would have sunk beneath the surfeit.
                    For, no sooner had <lb/>the Ambassador despatched one such visit, than another
                    <lb/>had to be undertaken. The same ceremonies were gone <lb/>through in
                    precisely the same order six or seven times <lb/>over at the houses of the other
                    great officials, so that it <lb/>was often late at night before the Ambassador
                    reached <lb/>home. Though Orlando performed these tasks to admi- <lb/>ration and
                    never denied that they are, perhaps, the most <lb/>important part of a
                    diplomatist’s duties, he was undoubt- <lb/>edly fatigued by them, and often
                    depressed to such a <lb/>pitch of gloom that he preferred to take his dinner
                    alone <lb/>with his dogs. To them, indeed he might be heard talk- <lb/>ing in
                    his own tongue. And sometimes, it is said, he <lb/>would pass out of his own
                    gates late at night so disguised <lb/>that the sentries did not know him. Then
                    he would <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="123">123</fw>
                    <pb n="6"/>
                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
                    <lb/>mingle with the crowd on the Galata Bridge: or stroll <lb/>through the
                    bazaars; or throw aside his shoes and join <lb/>the worshippers in the Mosques.
                    Once,when it was given <lb/>out that he was ill of a fever, shepherds, bringing
                    their <lb/>goats to market, reported that they had met an English <lb/>Lord on
                    the mountain top and heard him praying to his <lb/>God. This was thought to be
                    Orlando himself, and his <lb/>prayer was, no doubt, a poem said aloud, for it
                    was <lb/>known that he still carried about with him, in the bosom <lb/>of his
                    cloak, a much-scored manuscript; and servants, <lb/>listening at the door, heard
                    the Ambassador chanting <lb/>something in an odd, sing-song voice when he was
                    alone. </p>
                <p>
                    <lb/>It is with fragments such as these that we must do <lb/>our best to make up
                    a picture of Orlando's life and char- <lb/>acter at this time. There exist, even
                    to this day , rumours, <lb/>legends, anecdotes of a floating and unauthenticated
                    <lb/>kind about Orlando's life in Constantinople (we have <lb/>quoted but a few
                    of them) - which go to prove that he pos- <lb/>sessed, now that he was in the
                    prime of life, the power to <lb/>stir the fancy and rivet the eye which will
                    keep a memory <lb/>green long after all that more durable qualities can do to
                    <lb/>preserve it is forgotten. The power is a mysterious one <lb/>compounded of
                    beauty, birth, and some rarer gift, which <lb/>we may call glamour and have done
                    with it. “A million <lb/>candles," as Sasha had said, burnt in him without his
                    <lb/>being at the trouble of lighting a single one. He moved <lb/><fw
                        type="pageNum" rend="center" n="124">124</fw>
                    <pb n="7"/>
                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
                    <lb/>like a stag, without any need to think about his legs. He <lb/>spoke in his
                    ordinary voice and echo beat a silver gong. <lb/>Hence rumours gathered round
                    him. He became the <lb/>adored of many women and some men. It was not neces-
                    <lb/>sary that they should speak to him or even that they <lb/>should see him;
                    they conjured him up before them espe- <lb/>cially when the scenery was
                    romantic, or the sun was <lb/>setting, the figure of a noble gentleman in silk
                    stockings. <lb/>Upon the poor and uneducated, he had the same power <lb/>as upon
                    the rich. Shepherds, gipsies, donkey drivers, still <lb/>sing songs about the
                    English Lord “who dropped his <lb/>emeralds in the well,” which undoubtedly
                    refer to Or- <lb/>lando, who once it seems tore his jewels from him in a
                    <lb/>moment of rage or intoxication and flung them in a foun- <lb/>tain; whence
                    they were fished by a page boy. But this <lb/>romantic power,it is well known,
                    is often associated with <lb/>a nature of extreme reserve. Orlando seems to have
                    <lb/>made no friends. As far as is known, he formed no at- <lb/>tachments. A
                    certain great lady came all the way from <lb/>England in order to be near him,
                    and pestered him with <lb/>her attentions, but he continued to discharge his
                    duties <lb/>so indefatigably that he had not been Ambassador at <lb/>the Horn
                    more than two years and a half before King <lb/>Charles signified his intention
                    of raising him to the high- <lb/>est rank in the peerage. The envious said that
                    this was <lb/>Nell Gwyn’s tribute to the memory of a leg. But, as she <lb/><fw
                        type="pageNum" rend="center" n="125">125</fw>
                    <pb n="8"/>
                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
                    <lb/>had seen him once only, and was then busily engaged in <lb/>pelting her
                    royal master with nutshells, it is likely that <lb/>it was his merits that won
                    him his Dukedom, not his <lb/>calves. </p>

                    <lb/>Here we must pause, for we have reached a moment <lb/>of great signihcance
                    in his career. For the conferring of <lb/>the Dukedom was the occasion of a very
                    famous, and in <lb/>deed, much disputed incident, which we must now de-
                    <lb/>scribe, picking our way among burnt papers and little <lb/>bits of tape as
                    best we may. It was at the end of the great <lb/>fast of Ramadan that the Order
                    of the Bath and the <lb/>patent of nobility arrived in a frigate commanded by
                    Sir <lb/>Adrian Scrope; and Orlando made this the occasion for <lb/>an
                    entertainment more splendid than any that has been <lb/>known before or since in
                    Constantinople. The night was <lb/>fine; the crowd immense, and the windows of
                    the Em- <lb/>bassy brilliantly illuminated. Again, details are lacking, <lb/>for
                    the fire had its way with all such records, and has left <lb/>only tantalising
                    fragments which leave the most impor- <lb/>tant points obscure. From the diary
                    of ]ohn Fenner <lb/>Brigge, however, an English naval officer, who was
                    <lb/>among the guests, we gather that people of all national- <lb/>ities “were
                    packed like herrings in a barrel" in the court- <lb/>yard. The crowd pressed so
                    unpleasantly close that <lb/>Brigge soon climbed into a Judas tree, the better
                    to ob- <lb/>serve the proceedings. The rumour had got about among <lb/><fw

                    power over the imagination) that some kind <lb/>of miracle was to be performed.
                    "Thus," writes Brigge <lb/>(but his manuscript is full of burns and holes, some
                    sen- <lb/>tences being quite illegible) “when the rockets began <lb/>to soar
                    into the air, there was considerable uneasiness <lb/>among us lest the native
                    population . . . fraught with <lb/>unpleasant consequences to all, . . . English
                    ladies <lb/>in the company. . . . I own that my hand went to my <lb/>cutlass.
                    Happily," he continues in his somewhat long- <lb/>winded style, “these fears
                    seemed, for the moment, <lb/>groundless and, observing the demeanour of the
                    natives, <lb/>I came to the conclusion that this demonstration <lb/>of our skill
                    in the art of pyrotechny was valuable, . . . <lb/>because it impressed upon them
                    . . . superiority of the <lb/>British. . . . Indeed, the sight was one of
                    indescribable <lb/>magnificence. I found myself alternately praising the

                    theatrical display in which English <lb/>ladies and gentlemen . . . represented
                    a masque the <lb/>work of one .... The words were inaudible, but the <lb/>sight

                    of which I am certainly not ashamed, <lb/>though unable. . . . I was intent upon
                    observing the <lb/>astonishing conduct of Lady ——— which was of a nature <lb/>to
                    fasten the eyes of all upon her, and to bring discredit <lb/>upon her sex and
                    country, when"—— unfortunately a <lb/>branch of the ]udas tree broke, Lieutenant
                    Brigge fell to <lb/>the ground, and the rest of the entry records only his
                    <lb/>gratitude to Providence (who plays a very large part in <lb/>the diary) and
                    the exact nature of his injuries. </p>
                <p>Happily, Miss Penelope Hartopp, daughter of the <lb/>General of that name, saw
                    the scene from inside and <lb/>carries on the tale in a letter, much defaced
                    too, which <lb/>ultimately reached a female friend at Tunbridge Wells. <lb/>Miss
                    Penelope was no less lavish in her enthusiasm than <lb/>the gallant officer.

                <p>From the Gazette of the time, we gather that “as the <lb/>clock struck twelve,
                    the Ambassador appeared on the <lb/>centre Balcony which was hung with priceless
                    rugs. Six <lb/>Turks of the Imperial Body Guard, each over six foot in
                    <lb/>height, held torches to his right and left. Rockets rose <lb/>into the air
                    at his appearance, and a great shout went up <lb/>from the people, which the
                    Ambassador acknowledged, <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="129">129</fw>

                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
                    <lb/>bowing deeply, and speaking a few words of thanks in <lb/>the Turkish
                    language, which it was one of his accom- <lb/>plishments to speak with fluency.
                    Next, Sir Adrian <lb/>Scrope, in the full dress of a British Admiral advanced;
                    <lb/>the Ambassador knelt on one knee; the Admiral placed <lb/>the Collar of the
                    Most Noble Order of the Bath round his <lb/>neck, then pinned the Star to his
                    breast; after which <lb/>another gentleman of the diplomatic corps advancing
                    <lb/>in a stately manner placed on his shoulders the ducal <lb/>robes, and
                    handed him on a crimson cushion, the ducal <lb/>coronet." </p>
                <p>At length, with a gesture of extraordinary majesty <lb/>and grace, first bowing
                    profoundly, then raising himself <lb/>proudly erect, Orlando took the golden
                    circlet of straw- <lb/>berry leaves and placed it, with a gesture which none
                    <lb/>that saw it ever forgot, upon his brows. It was at this <lb/>point that the
                    first disturbance began. Either the people <lb/>had expected a miracle——some say
                    a shower of gold was <lb/>prophesied to fall from the skies——which did not hap-
                    <lb/>pen, or this was the signal chosen for the attack to begin; <lb/>nobody
                    seems to know; but as the coronet settled on Or- <lb/>lando's brows a great
                    uproar rose. Bells began ringing; <lb/>the harsh cries of the prophets were
                    heard above the <lb/>shouts of the people; many Turks fell flat to the ground
                    <lb/>and touched the earth with their foreheads. A door burst <lb/>open. The
                    natives pressed into the banqueting rooms. <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center"

                    <lb/>Women shrieked. A certain lady, who was said to be <lb/>dying for love of
                    Orlando, seized a candelabra and <lb/>dashed it to the ground. What might not
                    have happened, <lb/>had it not been for the presence of Sir Adrian Scrope and
                    <lb/>a squad of British bluejackets, nobody can say. But the <lb/>Admiral
                    ordered the bugles to be sounded; a hundred <lb/>bluejackets stood instantly at
                    attention; the disorder was <lb/>quelled, and quiet, at least for the time
                    being, fell upon <lb/>the scene. </p>
                <p>So far, we are on the firm, it rather narrow, ground <lb/>of ascertained truth.
                    But nobody has ever known exactly <lb/>what took place later that night. The
                    testimony of the <lb/>sentries and others seems, however, prove that the Em-
                    <lb/>bassy was empty of company, and shut up for the night <lb/>in the usual way
                    by two A.M. The Ambassador was seen <lb/>to go to his room, still wearing the
                    insignia of his rank, <lb/>and shut the door. Some say he locked it, which was
                    <lb/>against his custom. Others maintain that they heard <lb/>music of a rustic
                    kind, such as shepherds play, later that <lb/>night in the courtyard under the
                    Ambassador`s window. <lb/>A washer-woman, who was kept awake by a toothache
                    <lb/>said that she saw a man's figure, wrapped in a cloak or <lb/>dressing gown,
                    come out upon the balcony. Then, she <lb/>said, a woman, much muffled, but
                    apparently of the <lb/>peasant class was drawn up by means of a rope which the
                    <lb/>man let down to her on to the balcony. There, the <lb/><fw type="pageNum"

                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
                    <lb/>washer-woman said, they embraced passionately “like <lb/>lovers,’ and went
                    into the room together, drawing the <lb/>curtains so that no more could be seen. </p>
                <p>Next morning, the Duke, as we must now call him, <lb/>was found by his
                    secretaries sunk in profound slumber <lb/>amid bed clothes that were much
                    tumbled. The room <lb/>was in some disorder, his coronet having rolled on the
                    <lb/>floor, and his cloak and garter being flung all of a heap <lb/>on a chair.
                    The table was littered with papers. No sus- <lb/>picion was felt at first, as
                    the fatigues of the night had <lb/>been great. But when afternoon came and he
                    still slept, <lb/>a doctor was summoned. He applied the remedies which <lb/>had
                    been used on the previous occasion, plasters, nettles, <lb/>emetics, etc., but
                    without success. Orlando slept on. His <lb/>secretaries then thought it their
                    duty to examine the <lb/>papers on the table. Many were scribbled over with
                    <lb/>poetry, in which frequent mention was made of an oak <lb/>tree. There were
                    also various state papers and others of <lb/>a private nature concerning the
                    management of his es <lb/>tates in England. But at length they came upon a docu·
                    <lb/>ment of far greater significance. It was nothing less, <lb/>indeed, than a
                    deed of marriage, drawn up, signed, and <lb/>witnessed between his Lordship,
                    Orlando, Knight of <lb/>the Garter, etc. etc. etc., and Rosina Pepita, a dancer,
                    <lb/>father unknown, but reputed a gipsy, mother also un- <lb/>known but reputed
                    a seller of old iron in the market- <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center"

                    <lb/>place over against the Galata Bridge. The secretaries <lb/>looked at each
                    other in dismay. And still Orlando slept. <lb/>Morning and evening they watched
                    him, but, save that <lb/>his breathing was regular and his cheeks still flushed
                    <lb/>their habitual deep rose, he gave no sign of life. What <lb/>ever science
                    or ingenuity could do to waken him they <lb/>did. But still he slept. </p>
                <p>On the seventh day of his trance (Thursday, May the <lb/>1Oth) the first shot was
                    fired of that terrible and bloody <lb/>insurrection of which Lieutenant Brigge
                    had detected <lb/>the first symptoms. The Turks rose against the Sultan,
                    <lb/>set fire to the town, and put every foreigner they could <lb/>find, either
                    to the sword or to the bastinado. A few Eng- <lb/>lish managed to escape; but,
                    as might have been ex- <lb/>pected, the gentlemen of the British Embassy
                    preferred <lb/>to die in defence of their red boxes, or, in extreme cases,
                    <lb/>to swallow bunches of keys rather than let them fall into <lb/>the hands of
                    the Infidel.The rioters broke into Orlando’s <lb/>room, but seeing him stretched
                    to all appearance dead <lb/>they left him untouched, and only robbed him of his
                    <lb/>coronet and the robes of the Garter. </p>
                <p>
                    <lb/>And now again obscurity descends, and would indeed <lb/>that it were
                    deeper! Would, we almost have it in our <lb/>hearts to exclaim, that it were so
                    deep that we could see <lb/>nothing whatever through its opacity! Would that we

                    comes <lb/>our Lady of Chastity; on whose brow is set like a turret <lb/>of
                    burning but unwasting fire a diadem of icicles; her <lb/>eyes are pure stars,
                    and her fingers, if they touch you, i <lb/>freeze you to the bone. Close behind
                    her, sheltering n <lb/>deed in the shadow of her more stately sisters, comes our
                    <lb/>Lady of Modesty, frailest and fairest of the three; whose <lb/>face is only
                    shown as the young moon shows when it is <lb/>thin and sickle shaped and half
                    hidden among clouds. <lb/>Each advances towards the centre of the room where

                    <lb/>Orlando still lies sleeping; and with gestures at once ap- <lb/>pealing and
                    commanding, <emph rend="italics">Our Lady of Purity</emph> speaks <lb/>first:
                        <lb rend="indent"/>"I am the guardian of the sleeping fawn; the snow is
                    <lb/>dear to me; and the moon rising; and the silver sea. With <lb/>my robes I
                    cover the speckled hen`s eggs and the brin- <lb/>dled sea shell; I cover vice
                    and poverty. On all things <lb/>frail or dark or doubtful, my veil descends.
                    Wherefore, <lb/>speak not, reveal not. Spare, O spare! <lb rend="indent"/>Here
                    the trumpets peal forth. <lb rend="indent"/>‘Purity Avaunt! Begone Purity!</p>
                <p>Then <emph rend="italics">Our Lady Chastity</emph> speaks: <lb rend="indent"/>“I
                    am she whose touch freezes and whose glance turns <lb/>to stone. I have stayed
                    the star in its dancing, and the <lb/>wave as it falls. The highest Alps are my
                    dwelling place; <lb/>and when I walk, the lightnings flash in my hair; where

                    forth. <lb rend="indent"/>"Chastity Avaunt! Begone Chastity!"</p>
                <p>Then <emph rend="indent">Our Lady of Modesty</emph> speaks, so low that one

                    />"Modesty Avaunt! Begone Modesty!" </p>
                <p>With gestures of grief and lamentation the three sisters <lb/>now join hands and
                    dance slowly, tossing their veils and <lb/>singing as they go: <lb rend="indent"
                    />"Truth, come not out from your horrid den. Hide <lb/>deeper, fearful Truth.
                    For you flaunt in the brutal gaze <lb/>of the sun things that were better
                    unknown and un- <lb/>done; you unveil the shameful; the dark you make clear.
                    <lb/>Hide! Hide! Hide!" </p>
                <p> Here they make as if to cover Orlando with their <lb/>draperies. The trumpets,
                    meanwhile, still hlare forth: ”` <lb rend="indent"/>"The Truth and nothing but

                <p>At this the Sisters try to cast their veils over the mouths <lb/>of the trumpets
                    so as to muffle them, but in vain, for now <lb/>all trumpets blare forth
                    together. <lb rend="indent"/>"Horrid Sisters, go!"</p>
                <p>The Sisters become distracted and wail in unison,still <lb/>circling and flinging

                <p> They retire in haste, waving their draperies over their <lb/>heads, as if to

                    them. </p>
                <p>We are, therefore, now left entirely alone in the room <lb/>with the sleeping
                    Orlando and the trumpeters. The <lb/>trumpeters, ranging themselves side by side
                    in order, <lb/>blow one terrific blast: <lb rend="indent"/><emph rend="capitals"

                    <lb/>at which Orlando woke.</p>
                <p>
                    <lb/>He stretched himself. He rose. He stood upright in <lb/>complete nakedness
                    before us, and while the trumpets <lb/>pealed Truth! Truth! Truth! we have no
                    choice left but <lb/>confess——he was a woman.</p>

                <lb/>
                <fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
                <p>The sound of the trumpets died away and Orlando <lb/>stood stark naked. No human
                    being, since the world <lb/>began, has ever looked more ravishing. His form com-
                    ` <lb/>bined in one the strength of a man and a womans grace. <lb/>As he stood
                    there, the silver trumpets prolonged their <lb/>note, as if reluctant to leave
                    the lovely sight which their <lb/>blast had called forth; and Chastity, Purity,
                    and Mod- <lb/>esty, inspired, no doubt, by Curiosity, peeped in at the <lb/>door
                    and threw a garment like a towel at the naked form <lb/>which, unfortunately,
                    fell short by several inches. Or- <lb/>lando looked himself up and down in a
                    long looking <lb/>glass, without showing any signs of discomposure, and
                    <lb/>went, presumably, to his bath. </p>
                <p>We may take advantage of this pause in the narrative <lb/>to make certain
                    statements. Orlando had become a wom- <lb/>an——there is no denying it. But in
                    every other respect, <lb/>Orlando remained precisely as he had been. The change
                    <lb/>of sex, though it altered their future, did nothing what <lb/>ever to alter
                    their identity. Their faces remained, as their <lb/>portraits prove, practically
                    the same. His memory--but <lb/>in future we must, for convention's sake, say
                    'her' for <lb/>‘his,’ and ‘she’ for ‘he’—— her memory then, went back
                    <lb/>through all the events of her past life without encounter- <lb/>ing any
                    obstacle. Some slight haziness there may have <lb/>been, as if a few dark drops
                    had fallen into the clear pool <lb/>of memory; certain things had become a
                    little dimmed; <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="138">138</fw>
                    <pb n="23"/>
                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
                    <lb/>but that was all. The change seemed to have been accom- <lb/>plished
                    painlessly and completely and in such a way that <lb/>Orlando herself showed no
                    surprise at it. Many people, <lb/>taking this into account, and holding that
                    such a change <lb/>of sex is against nature, have been at great pains to prove
                    <lb/>(1) that Orlando had always been a woman, (2) that <lb/>Orlando is at this
                    moment a man. Let biologists and <lb/>psychologists determine. It is enough for
                    us to state the <lb/>simple fact; Orlando was a man till the age of thirty;
                    <lb/>when he became a woman and has remained so ever since. </p>
                <p>But let other pens treat of sex and sexuality; we quit <lb/>such odious subjects
                    as soon as we can. Orlando had now <lb/>washed, and dressed herself in those
                    Turkish coats and <lb/>trousers which can be worn indifferently by either sex;
                    <lb/>and was forced to consider her position. That it was pre- <lb/>carious and
                    embarrassing in the extreme must be the first <lb/>thought of every reader who
                    has followed her story with <lb/>sympathy. Young, noble, beautiful, she had
                    woken to <lb/>find herself in a position than which we can conceive <lb/>none
                    more delicate for a young lady of rank. We should <lb/>not have blamed her had
                    she rung the bell, screamed, or <lb/>fainted. But Orlando showed no such signs
                    of pertur- <lb/>bation. All her actions were deliberate in the extreme, <lb/>and
                    might indeed have been thought to show tokens of <lb/>premeditation. First, she
                    carefully examined the papers <lb/>on the table; took such as seemed to be
                    written in poetry, <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="139">139</fw>
                    <pb n="24"/>
                    <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
                    <lb/>and secreted them in her bosom; next she called her Se- <lb/>leuchi
                    hound,which had never left her bed all these days, <lb/>though half famished
                    with hunger, fed and combed <lb/>him; then stuck a pair of pistols in her belt;
                    finally wound <lb/>about her person several strings of emeralds and pearls
                    <lb/>of the finest orient which had formed part of her Ambas- <lb/>sadorial
                    wardrobe. This done, she leant out of the win- <lb/>dow, gave one low whistle,
                    and descended the shattered <lb/>and bloodstained staircase, now strewn with the
                    litter of <lb/>waste paper baskets, treaties, despatches, seals, sealing
                    <lb/>wax, etc., and so entered the courtyard. There, in the <lb/>shadow of a
                    giant fig tree waited an old Gipsy on a don- <lb/>key. He led another by the
                    bridle. Orlando swung her <lb/>leg over it; and thus, attended by a lean dog,
                    riding a <lb/>donkey, in company of a gipsy, the Ambassador of <lb/>Great
                    Britain at the Court of the Sultan left Constan- <lb/>tinople </p>
                <p>They rode for several days and nights and met with a <lb/>variety of adventures,
                    some at the hands of men, some at <lb/>the hands of nature, in all of which
                    Orlando acquitted <lb/>herself with courage. Within a week they reached the
                    <lb/>high ground outside Broussa which was then the chief <lb/>camping ground of
                    the gipsy tribe to which Orlando had <lb/>allied herself. Often she had looked
                    at those mountains <lb/>from her balcony at the Embassy; often had longed to be
                    <lb/>there; and to find oneself where one has longed to be <lb/><fw

                    <lb/>always, to a reflective mind, gives food for thought. For <lb/>some time,
                    however, she was too well pleased with the <lb/>change to spoil it by thinking.
                    The pleasure of having <lb/>no documents to seal, or sign, no flourishes to
                    make, no <lb/>calls to pay was enough. The gipsies followed the grass; <lb/>when
                    it was grazed down, on they moved again. She <lb/>washed in streams if she
                    washed at all; no boxes, red, <lb/>blue, or green were presented to her; there
                    was not a key, <lb/>let alone a golden key in the whole camp; as for ‘visiting,’
                    <lb/>the word was unknown. She milked the goats; she col- <lb/>lected brushwood;
                    she stole a hen’s egg now and then, <lb/>but always put a coin or a pearl in
                    place of it; she herded <lb/>cattle; she stripped vines; she trod the grape; she
                    filled <lb/>the goat-skin and drank from it; and when she remem- <lb/>bered how,
                    at about this time of day, she should have <lb/>been making the motions of
                    drinking and smoking over <lb/>an empty coffee cup and a pipe which lacked
                    tobacco, she <lb/>laughed aloud, cut herself another hunch of bread, and
                    <lb/>begged for a puff from old Rustum’s pipe, filled though <lb/>it was with
                    cow dung. </p>
                <p>The gipsies, with whom it is obvious that she must <lb/>have been in secret
                    communication before the revolu- <lb/>tion, seem to have looked upon her as one
                    of themselves <lb/>(which is always the highest compliment a people can
                    <lb/>pay) and her dark hair and dark complexion bore out <lb/>the belief that

                    <lb/>been snatched by an English Duke from a nut tree when <lb/>she was a baby
                    and taken to that barbarous land where <lb/>people live in houses because they
                    are too feeble and dis- <lb/>eased to stand the open air. Thus, though in many
                    ways <lb/>inferior to them, they were willing to help her to become <lb/>more
                    like them; taught her their arts of cheese-making <lb/>and basket-weaving, their
                    science of stealing and bird- <lb/>snaring, and were even prepared to consider
                    letting her <lb/>marry among them. </p>
                <p>But Orlando had contracted in England some of the <lb/>customs or diseases
                    (whatever you choose to consider <lb/>them) which cannot, it seems, be expelled.
                    One eve- <lb/>ning, when they were all sitting round the camp fire an <lb/>the
                    sunset was blazing over the Thessalian hills, Orlando <lb/>exclaimed: <lb

                <p>All the young men and women burst out laughing <lb/>uproariously. The sky good to

                    <lb/>had, became suspicious. They noticed that Orlando often <lb/>sat for whole
                    hours doing nothing whatever, except look <lb/>here and then there; they would
                    come upon her on some <lb/>hill-top staring straight in front of her, no matter
                    whether <lb/>the goats were grazing or straying. They began to sus- <lb/><fw

                    women thought it probable that she had <lb/>fallen into the clutches of the
                    vilest and cruelest among <lb/>all the Gods, which is Nature. Nor were they far
                    wrong. <lb/>The English disease, a love of Nature, was inborn in her, <lb/>and
                    here where Nature was so much larger and more <lb/>powerful than in England, she
                    fell into its hands as she <lb/>had never done before. The malady is too well
                    known, <lb/>and has been, alas, too often described to need describing
                    <lb/>afresh,save very briefly.There were mountains; there were <lb/>valleys;
                    there were streams. She climbed the mountains; <lb/>roamed the valleys; sat on
                    the banks of the streams. She <lb/>likened the hills to ramparts, and the plains
                    to the flanks <lb/>of kine. She compared the flowers to enamel and the turf
                    <lb/>to Turkey rugs worn thin.Trees were withered hags, and <lb/>sheep were grey
                    boulders. Everything, in fact, was some <lb/>thing else. She found the tarn on
                    the mountain-top and <lb/>almost threw herself in to seek the wisdom she thought
                    <lb/>lay hid there; and when, from the mountain-top, she <lb/>beheld, far off,
                    across the Sea of Marmara the plains of <lb/>Greece, and made out (her eyes were
                    admirable) the <lb/>Acropolis with a white streak or two which must, she
                    <lb/>thought, be the Parthenon, her soul expanded with her <lb/>eyeballs, and
                    she prayed that she might share the maj- <lb/>esty of the hills, know the
                    serenity of the plains, etc., etc., <lb/>as all such believers do. Then, looking

                    <lb/>hyacinth, the purple iris wrought her to cry out in ecstasy <lb/>at the
                    goodness, the beauty of nature; raising her eyes <lb/>again, she beheld the
                    eagle soaring, and imagined its <lb/>raptures and made them her own. Returning
                    home, she <lb/>saluted each star, each peak, and each watch-fire as if <lb/>they
                    signalled to her alone; and at last, when she flung <lb/>herself upon her mat in
                    the gipsies' tent, she could not <lb/>help bursting out again, How good to eat!
                    How good to <lb/>eat! (For it is a curious fact that though human beings
                    <lb/>have such imperfect means of communication, that they <lb/>can only say
                    ‘good to eat’ when they mean ‘beautiful' and <lb/>the other way about, they will
                    yet endure ridicule and <lb/>misunderstanding rather than keep any experience to
                    <lb/>themselves.) All the young gipsies laughed. But Rus- <lb/>tum el Sadi, the
                    old man who had brought Orlando out <lb/>of Constantinople on his donkey, sat
                    silent. He had a <lb/>nose like a scimitar; his cheeks were furrowed as if from
                    <lb/>the age-long descent of iron hail; he was brown and <lb/>keen-eyed, and as
                    he sat tugging at his hookah he ob- <lb/>served Orlando narrowly. He had the
                    deepest suspicion <lb/>that her God was Nature. One day, he found her in
                    <lb/>tears. Interpreting this to mean that her God had pun- <lb/>ished her, he
                    told her that he was not surprised. He <lb/>showed her the fingers of his left
                    hand, withered by the <lb/>frost; he showed her his right foot, crushed where a
                    rock <lb/>had fallen. This, he said, was what her God did to men. <lb/><fw

                    <lb/>When she said, “But so beautiful," using the English <lb/>word, he shook
                    his head; and when she repeated it he <lb/>was angry. He saw that she did not
                    believe what he be- <lb/>lieved, and that was enough, wise and ancient as he
                    was, <lb/>to enrage him. </p>
                <p>This difference of opinion disturbed Orlando, who <lb/>had been perfectly happy
                    until now. She began to think, <lb/>was Nature beautiful or cruel; and then she
                    asked herself <lb/>what this beauty was; whether it was in things them-
                    <lb/>selves, or only in herself; so she went on to the nature of <lb/>reality,
                    which led her to truth, which in its turn, led to <lb/>Love, Friendship, Poetry
                    (as in the days on the high <lb/>mound at home) which meditations, since she
                    could im- <lb/>part no word of them, made her long, as she had never <lb/>longed
                    before, for pen and ink. </p>
                <p>‘Oh! if only l could write !” she cried (for she had the <lb/>odd conceit of
                    those who write that words written are <lb/>shared). She had no ink; and but
                    little paper. But she <lb/>made ink from berries and wine; and finding a few
                    <lb/>margins and blank spaces in the manuscript of “The Oak <lb/>Tree,” managed,
                    by writing a kind of shorthand to de- <lb/>scribe the scenery in a long, blank
                    verse poem, and to <lb/>carry on a dialogue with herself about this Beauty and
                    <lb/>Truth concisely enough. This kept her extremely happy <lb/>for hours on
                    end. But the gipsies became suspicious. <lb/>First, they noticed that she was
                    less adept than before at <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="145">145</fw>

                    <lb/>milking and cheese-making; next, she often hesitated <lb/>before replying;
                    and once a gipsy boy who had been <lb/>asleep, woke in a terror feeling her eyes
                    upon him. Some <lb/>times this constraint would be felt by the whole tribe,
                    <lb/>numbering some dozens of grown men and women. It <lb/>sprang from the sense
                    they had (and their senses are very <lb/>sharp and much in advance of their
                    vocabulary) that <lb/>whatever they were doing crumbled like ashes in their
                    <lb/>hands. An old woman making a basket, a boy skinning <lb/>a sheep, would be
                    singing or crooning contentedly at <lb/>their work, when Orlando would come into
                    the camp, <lb/>fling herself down by the fire and gaze into the flames. <lb/>She
                    need not even look at them, and yet they felt, here <lb/>is someone who doubts;
                    (we make a rough-and-ready <lb/>translation from the gipsy language) here is
                    someone <lb/>who does not do the thing for the sake of doing; nor <lb/>looks for
                    looking`s sake; here is someone who believes <lb/>neither in sheep—skin nor
                    basket; but sees (here they <lb/>looked apprehensively about the tent) something
                    else. <lb/>Then a vague but most unpleasant feeling would begin to <lb/>work in
                    the boy and in the old woman. They broke their <lb/>withys; they cut their
                    fingers. A great rage filled them. <lb/>They wished Orlando would leave the tent
                    and never <lb/>come near them again. Yet she was of a cheerful and <lb/>willing
                    disposition, they owned; and one of her pearls <lb/>was enough to buy the finest
                    herd of goats in Broussa.</p>

                <p>Slowly, she began to feel that there was some differ- <lb/>ence between her and
                    the gipsies which made her hesi- <lb/>tate sometimes to marry and settle down
                    among them <lb/>for ever. At first she tried to account for it by saying that
                    <lb/>she came of an ancient and civilised race, whereas these <lb/>gipsies were
                    an ignorant people, not much better than <lb/>savages. One night when they were
                    questioning her <lb/>about England she could not help with some pride de-
                    <lb/>scribing the house where she was born, how it had 365 <lb/>bedrooms and had
                    been in the possession of her family <lb/>for four or five hundred years. Her
                    ancestors were earls, <lb/>or even dukes, she added. At this she noticed again
                    that <lb/>the gipsies were uneasy; but not angry as before when <lb/>she had
                    praised the beauty of nature. Now they were <lb/>courteous, but concerned as
                    people of fine breeding are <lb/>when a stranger has been made to reveal his low
                    birth or <lb/>poverty. Rustum followed her out of the tent alone and <lb/>said
                    that she need not mind if her father were a Duke, <lb/>and possessed all the
                    bedrooms and furniture that she <lb/>described. They would none of them think
                    the worse of <lb/>her for that. Then she was seized with a shame that she
                    <lb/>had never felt before. It was clear that Rustum and the <lb/>other gipsies
                    thought a descent of four or five hundred <lb/>years only the meanest possible.
                    Their own families went <lb/>back at least two or three thousand years. To the

                    <lb/>Christ was born, the genealogy of Howards and Plan- <lb/>tagenets was no
                    better and no worse than that of the <lb/>Smiths and the ]oneses: both were
                    negligible. More- <lb/>over, where the shepherd boy had a lineage of such an-
                    <lb/>tiquity, there was nothing specially memorable or de- <lb/>sirable in
                    ancient birth; vagabonds and beggars all shared <lb/>it. And then, though he was
                    too courteous to speak <lb/>openly, it was clear that the gipsy thought that
                    there was <lb/>no more vulgar ambition than to possess bedrooms by <lb/>the
                    hundred (they were on top of a hill as they spoke; it <lb/>was night; the
                    mountains rose around them) when the <lb/>whole earth is ours. Looked at from
                    the gipsy point of <lb/>view, a Duke, Orlando understood, was nothing but a
                    <lb/>profiteer or robber who snatched land and money from <lb/>people who rated
                    these things of little worth, and could <lb/>think of nothing better to do than
                    to build three hun- <lb/>dred and sixty-five bedrooms when one was enough, and
                    <lb/>none was even better than one. She could not deny <lb/>that her ancestors
                    had accumulated field after field; <lb/>house after house; honour after honour;
                    yet had none <lb/>of them been saints or heroes, or great benefactors of
                    <lb/>the human race. Nor could she counter the argument <lb/>(Rustum was too
                    much of a gentleman to press it, but <lb/>she understood) that any man who did
                    now what her an- <lb/>cestors had done three or four hundred years ago would
                    <lb/>be denounced——and by her own family most loudly <lb/><fw type="pageNum"

                <p>She sought to answer such arguments by the familiar <lb/>if oblique method of
                    finding the Gipsy life itself rude <lb/>and barbarous; and so, in a short time,
                    much bad blood <lb/>was bred between them. Indeed, such differences of
                    <lb/>opinion are enough to cause bloodshed and revolution. <lb/>Towns have been
                    sacked for less, and a million martyrs <lb/>have suffered at the stake rather
                    than yield an inch upon <lb/>any of the points here debated. No passion is
                    stronger in <lb/>the breast of man than the desire to make others believe

                    <lb/>leave the gipsies and become once more an Ambassador <lb/>seemed to her
                    intolerable. But it was equally impossible <lb/>to remain for ever where there
                    was neither ink nor writ- <lb/>ing paper, neither reverence for the Talbots, nor
                    respect <lb/>for a multiplicity of bedrooms. So she was thinking, one <lb/>fine
                    morning on the slopes of Mount Athos, when mind- <lb/>ing her goats. And then
                    Nature, in whom she trusted, <lb/>either played her a trick or worked a
                    miracle—again, <lb/>opinions dififer too much for it to be possible to say
                    which. <lb/>Orlando was gazing rather disconsolately at the steep <lb/>hill-side
                    in front of her. It was now midsummer, and if <lb/>we must compare the landscape
                    to anything it would <lb/>have been to a dry bone; to a sheep’s skeleton; to a
                    gigan- <lb/>tic skull picked white by a thousand vultures. The heat <lb/>was
                    intense and the little fig-tree under which Orlando <lb/>lay only served to
                    print patterns of fig-leaves upon her <lb/>light burnous. </p>
                <p>Suddenly, a shadow, though there was nothing to cast <lb/>a shadow, appeared on
                    the bald mountain-side opposite. <lb/>It deepened quickly and soon a green
                    hollow showed <lb/>where there had been barren rock before. As she looked,
                    <lb/>the hollow deepened and widened, and a great park—like <lb/>space opened in
                    the flank of the hill. Within, she could <lb/>see an undulating and grassy lawn;
                    she could see oak <lb/>trees dotted here and there; she could see the thrushes
                    <lb/>hopping among the branches. She could see the deer <lb/><fw type="pageNum"

                    <lb/>stepping delicately from shade to shade, and could even <lb/>hear the hum
                    of insects and the gentle sighs and shivers <lb/>of a summer's day in England.
                    After she had gazed en <lb/>tranced for some time, snow began falling; soon the
                    <lb/>whole landscape was covered and marked with violet <lb/>shades instead of
                    yellow sunlight. Now she saw heavy <lb/>carts coming along the roads, laden with
                    tree trunks, <lb/>which they were taking, she knew, to be sawn for fire-
                    <lb/>wood; and then there appeared the roofs and belfries and <lb/>towers and
                    courtyards of her own home. The snow was <lb/>falling steadily, and she could
                    now hear the slither and <lb/>flop which it made as it slid down the roof and
                    fell to the <lb/>ground. The smoke went up from a thousand chimneys. <lb/>All
                    was so clear and minute that she could see a daw <lb/>pecking for worms in the
                    snow. Then, gradually, the <lb/>violet shadows deepened and closed over the
                    carts and <lb/>the lawns and the great house itself. All was swallowed <lb/>up.
                    Now there was nothing left of the grassy hollow, <lb/>and instead of the green
                    lawns was only the blazing hill- <lb/>side which a thousand vultures seemed to
                    have picked <lb/>bare. At this, she burst into a passion of tears, and strid-
                    <lb/>ing back to the gipsies' camp, told them that she must <lb/>sail for
                    England the very next day. </p>
                <p>It was happy for her that she did so. Already the young <lb/>men had plotted her
                    death. Honour, they said, de- <lb/>manded it, for she did not think as they did.

                    <lb/>would have been sorry to cut her throat; and welcomed <lb/>the news of her
                    departure. An English merchant ship, <lb/>as luck would have it, was already
                    under sail in the har- <lb/>bour about to return to England; and Orlando, by
                    break- <lb/>ing of another pearl from her necklace not only paid her
                    <lb/>passage but had some banknotes left over in her wallet. <lb/>These she
                    would have liked to present to the gipsies. But <lb/>they despised wealth she
                    knew; and she had to content <lb/>herself with embraces, which on her part were
                    sincere. <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="151">151</fw>
